👋 Hello, I'm Eduardo Endo!

🔍 Data-Driven | Web Scraping | Data Engineering | People Analytics

🎓 I hold a degree in Chemical Engineering from Universidade Federal do Paraná, where I honed my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

💻 My journey into the data world began with Python, modeling chemical reactors—an experience that ignited my passion for data analysis and automation.

📊 After working in People Analytics, where I used data to drive strategic decision-making in talent management, I transitioned into Data Engineering. Now, I specialize in large-scale data ingestion, web scraping, and pipeline optimization.

🌍 Currently, I work as a Data Engineer, building robust data pipelines that transform raw data into actionable insights.

🚀 Passionate about web scraping, databases (SQL & NoSQL), and cloud technologies (GCP), I'm always looking for ways to improve data extraction and structuring processes.
